_**JCF, Mar-24-2021: documentation for DUNE DAQ release dunedaq-v2.4.0 can be found [here](https://dune-daq-sw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Only use this wiki for dunedaq-v2.3.0 and earlier**_

--------

Welcome to the Dune DAQ wiki!

This area can be used as a collaborative working area for documentation that has not yet been finalized. Once the task force has agreed to adopt a document, it should be placed in the repository, and the links here should be updated accordingly.

This wiki lives in the **appfwk** but it supposed to serve as a guideline for all the project.

Links below which contain "under vX.Y.Z" deal strictly with packages as they were versioned "vX.Y.Z", X, Y and Z all integers. Without an "under vX.Y.Z", it should be assumed that the instructions cover the behavior of the latest commits to software packages in question. 

**Developers are encouraged to follow the instructions for the most recent frozen releases (dunedaq-v2.3.0 as of Mar-2-2021)**
